# Example Lily Application

Here you will find a simple application that uses middleware, routes and cookies
to provide an insecure page `/` and secure admin pages under `/admin`.

To run this application you need PHP 5.3+ and then run this command:

``` php
php -S localhost:8000 index.php
```

**Make sure you run the command from this directory or fix the path to `index.php`.**

## Tests

The application is tested. You can find the tests inside the `test/` directory.

You can run `phpunit` command to run these tests.
